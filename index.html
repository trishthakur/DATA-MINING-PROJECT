                                        <h2>Smart Home Buying: Avoiding Pitfalls in Real Estate</h2>
                                        <p>For most Americans, buying a house is the largest purchase they will ever make. Given what's at stake, responsible home buyers should seek to make the most informed decision they can before buying a property. However, the real estate market is complicated and full of pitfalls that the average home buyer may not be aware of. A home could have mold, be in a floodplain, or have zoning restrictions, among a heap of other issues. Due to school zones and neighborhood homeowner associations, houses located even just a street apart may vary greatly in desirability.  Many homebuyer hopefuls turn over the reins to a real estate agent to smooth over the process, but this comes with its own problems. Real estate agents often get paid through commission, so they are incentivized to make deals and close them quickly, sometimes at the expense of their clients.  If the agent represents both parties, they are also incentivized to sell at a high price to maximize their commission, working against the homebuyer.</p>

                                        <h2>Informed Homebuying </h2>
                                        <p>To combat these issues, sites like Zillow and Redfin have come along that help homebuyers in a variety of ways. Their first and primary function is to serve as a place to view real estate listings. Buyers can create custom filters to sort houses by price, neighborhood, square footage, and other metrics they might be interested in. These sites also come with a valuation tool that displays the approximate value of a property given the price that comparative properties have recently sold at. Using these tools, even amateur homebuyers can perform basic market analysis to see if a real estate listing is selling at a discount or a premium. They can also use these tools to check the history of the property, including any history of renovations or upgrades, and applicable tax information. By looking at the school zones outlined on these websites, buyers can also easily tell which neighborhoods would better fit their needs.</p>

                                        <h2>Boulder's Housing Crisis: Skyrocketing Prices and Zoning Challenges</h2>
                                        <p>The real estate market in Boulder, Colorado is particularly woeful. Not only are the housing prices in Boulder the highest in the state, they are some of the highest in the entire country. With a home price to income ratio of greater than 10, even an average two bedroom apartment rents for more than 2400 dollars a month. This is largely due to the restrictive zoning laws that promote the construction of single family unit homes instead of larger projects that could house several or even dozens of families. The housing problem has become so great that many people who work or go to school in Boulder have been forced to move to surrounding towns such as Westminster, Broomfield, and Superior in search of cheaper housing. The cost of housing in Boulder only reinforces the need for homebuyers to make well informed decisions about what they value the most in a home, and perhaps more importantly, what they can live without.</p>

                                        <h2>Boulder Real Estate: Unraveling Valuations in Commercial and Industrial Sectors</h2>
                                        <p>Residential homes aren’t the only pieces of real estate on the Boulder market. Commercial and industrial real estate also form a large portion of the real estate market, and their valuations and the methods used to value these properties can differ drastically from the formula used for residential housing. In the commercial and industrial sectors, property value is often influenced by factors such as location, accessibility, and potential income-generating capabilities. Unlike the comparable sales approach commonly used in residential real estate, where the prices of similar properties in the area are considered as the primary metric of valuations. Additionally, the unique needs of businesses and industries can significantly impact the design and functionality of these properties, adding another layer of complexity to their valuation and assessment.</p>

                                        <h2>Boulder Homebuying Tool: Informed Decisions for Satisfactory Outcomes</h2>
                                        <p>Ultimately, through our analysis, we hope to create a tool that will help optimize the homebuying experience. By identifying the factors with the greatest influence on home prices in the Boulder area, buyers will be empowered to make more informed decisions about their purchases. They will gain the ability to directly compare the utility they derive from specific features of a house, such as its location, size, amenities, and condition, against the expected price of comparable properties. This tool will not only enhance transparency in the real estate market, but also assist buyers in finding properties that best align with their preferences and budgetary constraints, leading to more satisfactory homebuying outcomes.</p>

                                   <p>To perform a real estate analysis, we needed to gather information on the current state of real estate in Boulder, CO. Zillow is a website that posts current real estate for sale. Because of the format, web scraping had to be used to gather relevant information in a usable format. 
                                        An API combined with a Python HTML parser was used to gather residential (homes and townhouses) data from Zillow for Boulder, CO, on Sunday, March 17. Information was gathered on price, address, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square footage, latitude and longitude, and zestimate (Zillow's estimate of the home's value). There was no missing data, but not every home collected had a Zestimate. Missing Zestimates were marked with NaN. Price outliers were determined by being outside the range Median  1.5* IQR and were removed for better results in the modeling to come later. No other actions were needed on the beds, baths, and square footage features.

                                   <h2>Boulder County Sales Data:</h2>
                                   <p>To get data on previous years' residential sales, data was downloaded from the BoulderCounty.gov site. The website had data on all sales from 2018 to 2023, which were divided by property type (apartments, commercial, mixed-use, residential & condominiums, and vacant land) and year. Each year’s data was downloaded and imported into a Jupyter Notebook file. The yearly data was combined into one data frame for each property type.
                                        Outliers were removed on price using the same method as the Zillow data (Median  1.5* IQR). Of the remaining data, some had zero values for the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage. This was determined to be missing data, and these values were replaced with the average value for each factor.
                                   Square footage was broken down into above-ground sqft, finished basement sqft, unfinished basement sqft, garage sqft, and studio sqft. Zillow calculates its square footage based on above-ground, finished basement, and studio square footage, so these values were summed to match those found in Zillow. Bathrooms were also broken down into the number of full, three-quarter, and half bathrooms. Since Zillow counts full bathrooms and one and three-quarter and half bathrooms as one-half, the number of full bathrooms and one-half multiplied by the number of three-quarter and half bathrooms was calculated to match Zillow data. A new column was also made with just the sale year since we do not have data on sale month/day for the Zillow data, but it can be assumed that these properties will sell this year.

                                        Once the two data frames were in the same format, pd.concat() was used to combine the two data frames into one sales data frame with both Boulder County and Zillow data.

                                        It assumes that the features are independent of each other (even if they aren't), which simplifies the calculations. </p>

                                   <p>Gradient Boosting Classifier is like building a team of specialists. It combines multiple weak learners (simple models) to create a strong learner. 
                                        It works by repeatedly training new models to correct the errors of the previous ones. Each new model focuses on the mistakes made by the ensemble so far, gradually improving overall performance. 
                                        It's powerful for various tasks and often leads to highly accurate predictions</p>
