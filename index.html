                                        <h2>Smart Home Buying: Avoiding Pitfalls in Real Estate</h2>
                                        <p>For most Americans, buying a house is the largest purchase they will ever make. Given what's at stake, responsible home buyers should seek to make the most informed decision they can before buying a property. However, the real estate market is complicated and full of pitfalls that the average home buyer may not be aware of. A home could have mold, be in a floodplain, or have zoning restrictions, among a heap of other issues. Due to school zones and neighborhood homeowner associations, houses located even just a street apart may vary greatly in desirability.  Many homebuyer hopefuls turn over the reins to a real estate agent to smooth over the process, but this comes with its own problems. Real estate agents often get paid through commission, so they are incentivized to make deals and close them quickly, sometimes at the expense of their clients.  If the agent represents both parties, they are also incentivized to sell at a high price to maximize their commission, working against the homebuyer.</p>

                                        <h2>Informed Homebuying </h2>
                                        <p>To combat these issues, sites like Zillow and Redfin have come along that help homebuyers in a variety of ways. Their first and primary function is to serve as a place to view real estate listings. Buyers can create custom filters to sort houses by price, neighborhood, square footage, and other metrics they might be interested in. These sites also come with a valuation tool that displays the approximate value of a property given the price that comparative properties have recently sold at. Using these tools, even amateur homebuyers can perform basic market analysis to see if a real estate listing is selling at a discount or a premium. They can also use these tools to check the history of the property, including any history of renovations or upgrades, and applicable tax information. By looking at the school zones outlined on these websites, buyers can also easily tell which neighborhoods would better fit their needs.</p>

                                        <h2>Boulder's Housing Crisis: Skyrocketing Prices and Zoning Challenges</h2>
                                        <p>The real estate market in Boulder, Colorado is particularly woeful. Not only are the housing prices in Boulder the highest in the state, they are some of the highest in the entire country. With a home price to income ratio of greater than 10, even an average two bedroom apartment rents for more than 2400 dollars a month. This is largely due to the restrictive zoning laws that promote the construction of single family unit homes instead of larger projects that could house several or even dozens of families. The housing problem has become so great that many people who work or go to school in Boulder have been forced to move to surrounding towns such as Westminster, Broomfield, and Superior in search of cheaper housing. The cost of housing in Boulder only reinforces the need for homebuyers to make well informed decisions about what they value the most in a home, and perhaps more importantly, what they can live without.</p>

                                        <h2>Boulder Real Estate: Unraveling Valuations in Commercial and Industrial Sectors</h2>
                                        <p>Residential homes arenâ€™t the only pieces of real estate on the Boulder market. Commercial and industrial real estate also form a large portion of the real estate market, and their valuations and the methods used to value these properties can differ drastically from the formula used for residential housing. In the commercial and industrial sectors, property value is often influenced by factors such as location, accessibility, and potential income-generating capabilities. Unlike the comparable sales approach commonly used in residential real estate, where the prices of similar properties in the area are considered as the primary metric of valuations. Additionally, the unique needs of businesses and industries can significantly impact the design and functionality of these properties, adding another layer of complexity to their valuation and assessment.</p>

                                        <h2>Boulder Homebuying Tool: Informed Decisions for Satisfactory Outcomes</h2>
                                        <p>Ultimately, through our analysis, we hope to create a tool that will help optimize the homebuying experience. By identifying the factors with the greatest influence on home prices in the Boulder area, buyers will be empowered to make more informed decisions about their purchases. They will gain the ability to directly compare the utility they derive from specific features of a house, such as its location, size, amenities, and condition, against the expected price of comparable properties. This tool will not only enhance transparency in the real estate market, but also assist buyers in finding properties that best align with their preferences and budgetary constraints, leading to more satisfactory homebuying outcomes.</p>
